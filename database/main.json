					"\nThe amount of preparation taken by the authorities and citizens makes a significant difference to the impact of an earthquake\nGenerally, the damage caused by an earthquake is more manageable when people are better prepared for it (evacuation plans, trained rescue workers, range of action plans, etc.)\n\n\nPositive example: For example, every year since 1960, Japan has been practising emergency drills on September 1st to commemorate Disaster Prevention Day. This is done so that people are more mentally and physically prepared for an earthquake.\nNegative example: However, in less-developed countries such as Haiti, emergency drills may not be frequently practised. Thus, even though it had a lower magnitude of 7.0 than the Tohoku earthquake in Japan, Haiti experienced a much higher death toll due to a lower level of preparedness\nNegative example: However emergency drills are often designed based on the most serious earthquake recorded\nWhen the next earthquake is on a larger scale not experienced before, the emergency drills may still be inadequate to prevent the devastation by the earthquake\nE.g. Tohoku earthquake, Japan in 2011 was one of the largest scale earthquakes ever experienced by Japan",
					"\nOccurs between 70 and 700km below earth’s surface\nSmaller impact on the land as vibrations or seismic waves take a longer time to reach the surface and would have lost most of their energy",
					"\nCan occur at convergent, divergent and transform plate boundaries\nMost frequently at convergent plate boundaries, such as the earthquake in Tohoku, Japan, 2011, and the earthquake in the Indian Ocean in 2004\n¾ found along Pacific Ring of Fire\nCan also occur some distance away from plate boundaries e.g. Sichuan earthquake, 2008",
					"\nEarthquake is a vibration in the earth’s crust caused by the sudden release of stored energy in the rocks\nThis occurs due to plate movements along plate boundaries",
					"\nShaking of the ground can weaken the slopes of hills and mountains. The unstable slopes may result in landslides (rapid downslope movement of soil, rock and vegetation debris from a slope). Can range from several metres to kilometres in length and width. Mudflows can also occur when there is heavy rainfall which saturates the soil, causing mixed soil debris to flow down the slope\n\n\nExample: The earthquake off the coast of Peru, in 1970 destabilised the slopes of Mount Huascaran and triggered a ma",
					"\nPlate movements cause the slow build-up of stress on the rocks found on either side of the fault\nWhen the rocks can no longer withstand&nbsp;",
					"\nSeismograph: records the seismic waves released by an earthquake\nSpring-mounted weight moves up and down when tremors are detected\nThe distance",
					"\nrthquake releases energy in the form of seismic waves from the focus\nThe earth’s surface directly above the focus is the epicentre\nAfter the earthquake, stress from the ground may cause smaller earthquakes called aftershocks. Some aftershocks may be as powerful as the original",
					"\nThe higher the population density, the greater the extent of damage caused by an earthquake\nEarthquake in sparsely populated areas such as rural villages would affect fewer people\nThus, the death toll and destruction to infrastructure would be significantly lower as opposed to densely",
					"\nAs epicentre is directly above the earthquake focus, the closer an area is to the epicentre experienced the greater shaking, the greater extent of damage caused by the earthquake\n",

					"the amount of preparation taken by the authorities and citizens make a significant difference. generally an earthquake is more manageable when people are better prepared for it\n\nfor example, since 1960, on every september 1st, japan carries out emergency drills to commemorate disaster prevention day. this helps people to be more mentally and even physically prepared for an earthquake\n\nhowever, in less-developed countries such as haiti, emergency drills may not be frequently carried out. hence during the earthquake in haiti in 2010, it suffered a higher death toll of 300,000 than japan at 28,000\n\nhowever emergency drills are often designed based on the most serious earthquake ever recorded in the area\nif an earthquake of a large scale never experienced before occurs, emergency drills may be inadequate to prevent the devastation caused by the earthquake\nfor example, the tohoku earthquake in japan in 2011 with a magnitude of 9.0&nbsp; was on a scale never seen before",
					"earthquake releases different amount of energy (aka magnitude of an earthquake\nit is measured on a seismograph on a scale of 1.0 to 9.0 on the richter scale, where each increasing magnitude if 10 times stronger than the previous one\n\nthe highest magnitude ever recorded was in valdivia, chile 1960 at magnitude of 9.5. generally earthquakes of higher magnitude results in greater extent of damage however this can also be affected by other factors such as population density, time of occurrence, type of soil, distance from epicentre, level of preparedness",
					"in areas with loose and unconsolidated sediments, seismic waves are amplified, causing greater shaking and hence greater extent of damage\nbuildings built on loose and saturated soil can also face liquefaction. liquefaction is where shaking of the ground causes the mixed loose soil debris to flow like liquid, sinking buildings\n\nfor example, the earthquake in Christchurch new zealand in 2011 with a magnitude of 6.1, the eastern sections of the city were built on a former swamp, hence it faced liquefaction. caused the properties and streets to be buried by a thick layer of silt and had to be abandoned",
					"time of occurrence determines where people are and what they are doing, thus affecting their chance of survival. if an earthquake occurs at night when most people are sleeping, more people would be trapped in buildings as they are less aware of their surroundings, resulting in more deaths\n\nfor example, the sun moon lake region of Taiwan, in 1999 an earthquake occurred hours after midnight, even though the magnitude was high at 7.5, the high death toll of 2400 is attributed to the time of occurrence"

An example of an oceanic-oceanic plate divergence is between the Eurasian plate and North American plate.\n\n\nAs the two continental plates diverge from each other at the oceanic-oceanic boundaries, fractures are formed at the plate boundary. Magma rises at the zone of divergence to fill the gap between the plates.

A fault is a fracture in the rocks along which rocks are displaced, which is caused by tensional forces. This occurs in a process called faulting. As sections of the crust extend along fault lines, the central block between two parallel faults sinks due to tensional forces. Thus, a rift valley is formed. An example is the East African Rift Valley (or Great Rift Valley; African Rift Valley). A rift valley is a valley with steep sides.

Seismic energy from an offshore earthquake forces out a mass of seawater\n2. Tsunami waves may start at height of less than 1m with waves lengths of 100-150m\n3. Reaching shallower water, greater friction slows waves and forces them to increase in height\n4. At point of impact on coast, tsunami waves could be travelling at 30-50km/h with heights of 15m\n5. Sometimes, sea recedes from coast before advancing onshore (minutes before tsunami reaches shore) to fill the void caused by movement of the sea floor. Water is then forced out again soon afterwards, resulting in a tsunami\n\n\nExample:\nIn 2004, a 9.2 magnitude earthquake occurred in the Indian Ocean and triggered a tsunami which travelled over a long distance, causing damage to coastal communities in 12 countries\nMost damage was experienced in the low-lying coastal areas of western Sumatra, Indonesia, including the city of Banda Aceh.\nWaves were 4-39m high and went inland as far as 10 kilometres.\nHouses swept inland or out to sea",

													"‘Developed countries are better able to respond to the negative effects of an earthquake.’ To what extent do you agree with this statement? Explain your answer with examples": [
														"I agree with this answer to a large extent. There are many ways a country can respond to the negative effects of an earthquake. When a country responds to an earthquake, it also prepares for the next one by improving its current preparation methods. Less developed countries are much more limited in terms of what they can do to respond to the negative effects of an earthquake.\n\n\nOne way a country can respond to the negative effects of an earthquake is by rebuilding infrastructure. Less developed countries have limited resources such as funding to rebuild infrastructure that was damaged during the earthquake. Not only that, they may also lack the authority power to enforce stricter building codes, hence infrastructure may be rebuilt again without improvements made to the building code. Whereas developed countries have the resources and authority to rebuild infrastructure and enforce stricter building codes. Infrastructures are rebuilt and improved successfully after an earthquake. For example, after the earthquake in Kobe, Japan in 1995, the government spent billions in developing more earthquake resistant buildings. Hence, rebuilding infrastructure is one way a country can respond to the negative effects of an earthquake\n\n\nA country can also provision health care. To help injured victims or psychologically disturbed victims restore their livelihood, health options such as counselling is provided. This would allow them to cope with the loss of homes, jobs and loved ones better. But in a less developed country, such as Haiti for example, was unable to provide sufficient health workers for a large number of people after the earthquake in 2010. Providing sufficient medical care for the population was in itself a challenge due to the high death toll and number of casualties. In addition, it faced a lack of medical centres and medical staff to provide basic health care. Thus, more advanced medical aid such as counselling would be even more challenging.\n\n\nA country can also carry out search and rescue as a response to the negative effects of an earthquake. Search and rescue and save people who are still trapped in the buildings especially after earthquakes where buildings face a risk of collapsing, trapping the people inside it. But in a less developed country such as Haiti, lack of resources such as heat sensors and sniffer dogs hinder the effectiveness of this response and may be rendered ineffective. \n\n\nAlthough there are many ways a country can respond to the negative effects of an earthquake, less developed countries are heavily limited by their extent of funding, and availability of resources, as opposed to developed countries.",

													"‘Developed countries are better able to respond to the negative effects of an earthquake.’ To what extent do you agree with this statement? Explain your answer with examples": [
														"I agree with this answer to a large extent. There are many ways a country can respond to the negative effects of an earthquake. When a country responds to an earthquake, it also prepares for the next one by improving its current preparation methods. Less developed countries are much more limited in terms of what they can do to respond to the negative effects of an earthquake.\n\n\nOne way a country can respond to the negative effects of an earthquake is by rebuilding infrastructure. Less developed countries have limited resources such as funding to rebuild infrastructure that was damaged during the earthquake. Not only that, they may also lack the authority power to enforce stricter building codes, hence infrastructure may be rebuilt again without improvements made to the building code. Whereas developed countries have the resources and authority to rebuild infrastructure and enforce stricter building codes. Infrastructures are rebuilt and improved successfully after an earthquake. For example, after the earthquake in Kobe, Japan in 1995, the government spent billions in developing more earthquake resistant buildings. Hence, rebuilding infrastructure is one way a country can respond to the negative effects of an earthquake\n\n\nA country can also provision health care. To help injured victims or psychologically disturbed victims restore their livelihood, health options such as counselling is provided. This would allow them to cope with the loss of homes, jobs and loved ones better. But in a less developed country, such as Haiti for example, was unable to provide sufficient health workers for a large number of people after the earthquake in 2010. Providing sufficient medical care for the population was in itself a challenge due to the high death toll and number of casualties. In addition, it faced a lack of medical centres and medical staff to provide basic health care. Thus, more advanced medical aid such as counselling would be even more challenging.\n\n\nA country can also carry out search and rescue as a response to the negative effects of an earthquake. Search and rescue and save people who are still trapped in the buildings especially after earthquakes where buildings face a risk of collapsing, trapping the people inside it. But in a less developed country such as Haiti, lack of resources such as heat sensors and sniffer dogs hinder the effectiveness of this response and may be rendered ineffective. \n\n\nAlthough there are many ways a country can respond to the negative effects of an earthquake, less developed countries are heavily limited by their extent of funding, and availability of resources, as opposed to developed countries.",
