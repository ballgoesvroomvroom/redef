													"‘Developed countries are better able to respond to the negative effects of an earthquake.’ To what extent do you agree with this statement? Explain your answer with examples": [
														"I agree with this answer to a large extent. There are many ways a country can respond to the negative effects of an earthquake. When a country responds to an earthquake, it also prepares for the next one by improving its current preparation methods. Less developed countries are much more limited in terms of what they can do to respond to the negative effects of an earthquake.\n\n\nOne way a country can respond to the negative effects of an earthquake is by rebuilding infrastructure. Less developed countries have limited resources such as funding to rebuild infrastructure that was damaged during the earthquake. Not only that, they may also lack the authority power to enforce stricter building codes, hence infrastructure may be rebuilt again without improvements made to the building code. Whereas developed countries have the resources and authority to rebuild infrastructure and enforce stricter building codes. Infrastructures are rebuilt and improved successfully after an earthquake. For example, after the earthquake in Kobe, Japan in 1995, the government spent billions in developing more earthquake resistant buildings. Hence, rebuilding infrastructure is one way a country can respond to the negative effects of an earthquake\n\n\nA country can also provision health care. To help injured victims or psychologically disturbed victims restore their livelihood, health options such as counselling is provided. This would allow them to cope with the loss of homes, jobs and loved ones better. But in a less developed country, such as Haiti for example, was unable to provide sufficient health workers for a large number of people after the earthquake in 2010. Providing sufficient medical care for the population was in itself a challenge due to the high death toll and number of casualties. In addition, it faced a lack of medical centres and medical staff to provide basic health care. Thus, more advanced medical aid such as counselling would be even more challenging.\n\n\nA country can also carry out search and rescue as a response to the negative effects of an earthquake. Search and rescue and save people who are still trapped in the buildings especially after earthquakes where buildings face a risk of collapsing, trapping the people inside it. But in a less developed country such as Haiti, lack of resources such as heat sensors and sniffer dogs hinder the effectiveness of this response and may be rendered ineffective. \n\n\nAlthough there are many ways a country can respond to the negative effects of an earthquake, less developed countries are heavily limited by their extent of funding, and availability of resources, as opposed to developed countries.",

The magma also cools and solidifies on the earth’s ocean floor, creating new sea floor in a process known as sea-floor spreading. Oceanic-oceanic plate divergence forms a mid-oceanic ridge, such as the Mid Atlantic Ridge. An oceanic ridge is essentially a range of underwater mountains. At some areas, magma builds up above the sea level and forms volcanic islands such as the Azores in the North Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\nAs a result of this tectonic activity, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are common at the plate boundary",

A fault is a fracture in the rocks along which rocks are displaced, which is caused by tensional forces. This occurs in a process called faulting. As sections of the crust extend along fault lines, the central block between two parallel faults sinks due to tensional forces. Thus, a rift valley is formed. An example is the East African Rift Valley (or Great Rift Valley; African Rift Valley). A rift valley is a valley with steep sides. The sections which are left standing beside the rift valley are block mountains. At some areas, magma rises to the earth’s surface to form volcanoes.

Seismic energy from an offshore earthquake forces out a mass of seawater\n2. Tsunami waves may start at height of less than 1m with waves lengths of 100-150m\n3. Reaching shallower water, greater friction slows waves and forces them to increase in height\n4. At point of impact on coast, tsunami waves could be travelling at 30-50km/h with heights of 15m\n5. Sometimes, sea recedes from coast before advancing onshore (minutes before tsunami reaches shore) to fill the void caused by movement of the sea floor. Water is then forced out again soon afterwards, resulting in a tsunami\n\n\nExample:\nIn 2004, a 9.2 magnitude earthquake occurred in the Indian Ocean and triggered a tsunami which travelled over a long distance, causing damage to coastal communities in 12 countries\nMost damage was experienced in the low-lying coastal areas of western Sumatra, Indonesia, including the city of Banda Aceh.\nWaves were 4-39m high and went inland as far as 10 kilometres.\nHouses swept inland or out to sea",

													"‘Developed countries are better able to respond to the negative effects of an earthquake.’ To what extent do you agree with this statement? Explain your answer with examples": [
														"I agree with this answer to a large extent. There are many ways a country can respond to the negative effects of an earthquake. When a country responds to an earthquake, it also prepares for the next one by improving its current preparation methods. Less developed countries are much more limited in terms of what they can do to respond to the negative effects of an earthquake.\n\n\nOne way a country can respond to the negative effects of an earthquake is by rebuilding infrastructure. Less developed countries have limited resources such as funding to rebuild infrastructure that was damaged during the earthquake. Not only that, they may also lack the authority power to enforce stricter building codes, hence infrastructure may be rebuilt again without improvements made to the building code. Whereas developed countries have the resources and authority to rebuild infrastructure and enforce stricter building codes. Infrastructures are rebuilt and improved successfully after an earthquake. For example, after the earthquake in Kobe, Japan in 1995, the government spent billions in developing more earthquake resistant buildings. Hence, rebuilding infrastructure is one way a country can respond to the negative effects of an earthquake\n\n\nA country can also provision health care. To help injured victims or psychologically disturbed victims restore their livelihood, health options such as counselling is provided. This would allow them to cope with the loss of homes, jobs and loved ones better. But in a less developed country, such as Haiti for example, was unable to provide sufficient health workers for a large number of people after the earthquake in 2010. Providing sufficient medical care for the population was in itself a challenge due to the high death toll and number of casualties. In addition, it faced a lack of medical centres and medical staff to provide basic health care. Thus, more advanced medical aid such as counselling would be even more challenging.\n\n\nA country can also carry out search and rescue as a response to the negative effects of an earthquake. Search and rescue and save people who are still trapped in the buildings especially after earthquakes where buildings face a risk of collapsing, trapping the people inside it. But in a less developed country such as Haiti, lack of resources such as heat sensors and sniffer dogs hinder the effectiveness of this response and may be rendered ineffective. \n\n\nAlthough there are many ways a country can respond to the negative effects of an earthquake, less developed countries are heavily limited by their extent of funding, and availability of resources, as opposed to developed countries.",

					"a tsunami is an unusually large sea wave formed by movement of sea floors, explosive underwater volcanic eruptions, landslides that occur above ground level causing materials to plunge into the water, this can be caused by earthquakes and volcanoes",
					"a divergent plate boundary occurs when two plates move away from each other\nfor example between north american and eurasian plate\n\nwhen the two plates move away from each other, fractures are formed at the zone of divergence. magma then rises out of the fracture to fill in the gap. the magma cools quickly and solidifies onto the sea floor, forming new sea floor, in a process known as sea floor spreading\nan mid-oceanic ridge is formed such as the mid atlantic ridge. an oceanic ridge is essentially a range of underwater mountains. at some areas, magma can rise above sea level to form volcanic islands such as the Azores in the North Atlantic Ocean\n\nas a result of this tectonic activity, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are common at the the plate boundary",

					"a convergent plate boundary is when move towards each other\npacific and eurasian plate\n\nwhen the plates move towards each other, it collides and pushes against each other, resisting subduction. this causes the plates to break and slide along fractures in the crust. due to the immense pressure, the upper layer of the crust is compressed, buckles and folds either upwards or sideways to form fold mountains such as the himalayan mountains",
					"refers to the movement of heat in the mantle material\nas the mantle material gets heated up by earth's cores, it causes it to expand and rise, spreading out, pulling the plates along. this causes divergent plate boundaries\nas the mantle material cools slightly, it sinks, dragging the plates along, this causes convergent plate boundaries\nas the mantle material nears earth's core heated up again, the whole process repeats again",
					"a form of preparedness measure where people practise the steps to take during an earthquake. this aims to raise awareness and reduce the level of panic and irrational behaviour\n\nfor example, since 1960, on every september 1st, japan has been commemorating disaster prevention day where an earthquake of high magnitude is simulated. this helps the people to be more mentally and even physically prepared for an earthquake\n\nthis can reduce loss of lives\n\nhowever in less developed countries such as haiti, emergency drills may not be frequently practised. this is why the earthquake in 2010 in Haiti with a magnitude of 7.0 suffered 300,000 death tolls as compared to japan's earthquake in tohoku 2011 with magnitude of 9.0 28,000 death toll. haiti suffered a much higher death toll than japan\n\nemergency drills are often designed based on the most serious recorded earthquakes. when an earthquake of larger scale never experienced before, emergency drills may be inadequate to prevent the devastation caused by the earthquake\nemergency drills require sufficient time to be efficient. often times, there is insufficient time to escape as earthquakes are hard to predict and hence warnings are made seconds before it actually strikes",

					"a divergent plate boundary is when two plates move away from one another\nfor example between the african (nubian) and african (somalian) plate\n\nwhen the two plates move away from one another, fractures are formed along the plate boundary. fault lines are fractures along rocks which rocks are displaced. as the sections of the crust extend along fault lines, the middle section sinks due to tensional forces, in a process known as faulting. this creates a rift valley a valley with steep sides. such as the east african rift valley or the great eastern rift valley. the sections left standing beside the rift valley is known as block mountains.\nat some areas, magma may rise from the surface to form volcanoes such as the Erta Ale, Ethopia\n\nas a result of this tectonic activity, earthquake and volcanic eruptions are common at this plate boundary",

					"mixture of pyroclastic flow and melted glacial ice from mountain tops that flows down the sides of a volcano",
					"technological developments such as monitoring and warning systems allow scientists to warn people of potential hazards so that they can evacuate\n\nfor example, in usa\nthey have earthquake monitoring and warning systems\nmonitoring earthquakes is done by studying past earthquakes\nthis allows the estimation of frequency and magnitude of an earthquake\nwhich allows seismic risks map to be created\nearthquake monitoring devices such as seismographs are placed in earthquake prone areas to monitor closely the frequency of vibrations in the place\n\nin hawaii, there are tsunami monitoring and warning devices\nthe tsunami monitoring devices help predict occurrences of tsunamis and are tied to the warning system\nhawaii has a network of tsunami detectors, seismographs, and deep ocean tsunami sensors\n\nthis allows the population to be warned so that they can be evacuated reducing loss of lives\n\nhowever earthquake sensors are expensive costly to obtain install and use\nseismic risks map only show which areas are at risk and hence do not give precise information such as the time, location and magnitude of future earthquakes\nnoise, lighting or device failures can interfere with monitoring devices\nhard to give accurate readings when multiple earthquakes occur close to each other\nwhen waves are large, may trigger the tsunami sensors, resulting in false alarms\ninadequate as evacuation requires sufficient time to evacuate\noften times, there is insufficient time to evacuate as tsunamis are hard to predict, hence a warning is usually given out seconds before the actual occurrence",
					"the amount of preparedness taken by the authorities the citizens can make a significant difference on the extent of damage. generally an earthquake is more manageable when people are well prepared for it such as through evacuation routes, trained rescue workers and a range of action plans.\n\nfor example, in japan since 1960, on every september 1st, it commemorates disaster prevention day where an earthquake of high magnitude is simulated. this helps people to be more mentally and even physically prepared for an earthquake\n\nhowever in less developed countries, such as haiti, earthquakes may not be frequently practised. the earthquake in haiti in 2010 with a lower magnitude of 7.0 than the earthquake in tohoku, japan in 2011 at 9.0, resulted in 300,000 death toll, much higher than japan's 28,000 death toll. as a result of haiti is unprepared, hence higher death toll",

					"volcanic eruptions can release fine ash clouds that can disrupt human daily activities\nthe thick plumes of ash clouds can block sunlight, suffocate crops, cause serious respiratory issues to animals and people, and can also contain poisonous gas such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide\ninhaling of these poisonous gas can result in serious injury and even death\nthe tiny ash particles (&lt; 0.001 millimetres) can be carried by wind over thousands of kilometres, causing damage over a much wider area\n\nfor example, the eruption of mount pinatubo in 1995 in philippines resulted in million of tonnes of ash to be ejected which buried large tracts of farmlands and caused shelters to collapse\nor the eruption in iceland in 2010 which resulted in the production of an extensive ash cloud that posed a serious danger to aircraft engines. this resulted in the closure of airspace of much of Europe and cancellation of flights. which costed the airline industry US$1.8billion and delays of up to 1.2million passengers daily",
					"lava, ash and rock fragments can breakdown to form volcanic soil which is fertile and hence beneficial for agriculture (farming)\n\nfor example, the two islands of Java and Bali, Indonesia contains fertile soil which cultivates the growth of crops such as coffee, tea and rice. this is how the two islands are able to support large rural populations for years. source of income cash crops coffee tea source of food crops such as rice",
					"refers to the upward movement of magma through a vent onto earth's surface is known as vulcanity",
					"tourists can hike, camp and enjoy the scenery of volcanic areas\nthey can also learn about the history of the volcanic area\n\nfor example, when mount vesuvius erupted in 79 CE, it buried pompeii, italy with thick layers of lava. unearthed archaeological site revealed buildings, pottery and mosaics which now attracts more than 3million visitors yearly\nin japan, onsen hotels and hot springs are made possible by volcanic steam which attracts million of tourists each year",
					"derived from the heat from earth's core\nwhen groundwater comes into contact with hot rocks beneath earth's surface, they erupt as hot water or steam. which can be harnessed to drive wind turbines and produce electricity. great source of renewable energy as no greenhouse gas is produced to generate the electricity\n\nfor example, in iceland, due to the large number of volcanoes in the country, it uses geothermal energy. more than 70% of homes in iceland are heated using volcanic steam",

					"movements of plates causes a slow build up of stress in the rocks on either side of the fault line\nwhen the stress is eventually released, the plates can slip many metres, resulting in an earthquake",
					"a convergent plate boundary is where plates move towards each other\nfor example, between the pacific plate and philippines plate\n\nwhen the two plates move towards each other, they collide and push against each other. the denser slower moving pacific plate subducts under the less dense philippines plate. this causes a depression to be formed on the sea floor at the zone of divergence. an oceanic trench is formed such as the mariana trench. the upper layer of the subducted pacific plate can melt to form magma which rises and solidifies, forming volcanic islands such as the mariana islands.\n\nas a result of this tectonic activity, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are common at the plate boundary",
					"occupies 80% of the earth's volume&nbsp;at 2100km thick\na solid layer where rocks flow under high temperature and pressure\nwith temperatures ranging from 800 to 3000C\nconsists of the lower and upper mantle\nthe upper mantle is a layer of solid rocks\nin the mantle, high temperature and pressure brings rocks close to their melting points, causing them to deform, forming molten rocks, or magma",
					"occurs within the upper 70km of earth's crust\ngreater impact on surface as the seismic waves or vibrations reaches the earth's surface quickly",
					"occurs when two plates slide past one another\nsuch as between the pacific and north american plate\n\nwhen the two plates slide past one another, no landforms are formed but transform fault are formed such as the transform anatolian fault. at the fault, huge amount of pressure gets built up. when the stress pressure is eventually released, violent earthquakes occur\n\nas a result of this tectonic activity, earthquakes are common at the plate boundaries, no volcanic eruptions occur as there is no subduction of plates",
					"earthquakes are measured using seismographs\nspring-mounted weight moves up and down when tremors are detected\nthe magnitude closely relates to how far a location shifts as a result of the earthquake\nthe distance a location shift is the magnitude of the earthquake",
					"earthquake releases different amount of energy, aka magnitude of an earthquake\nmeasured on a richter scale from 1.0 to 9.0 where each increasing magnitude is 10 times stronger than the previous one\n\nthe highest magnitude ever recorded was in 1960 in Valdivia, Chile, with a magnitude of 9.5. generally an earthquake of higher magnitude will result in greater extent of damage\nhowever this can also be caused by other factors such as time of occurrence, soil type, population density, distance from epicentre and level of preparedness\nfor example in haiti in 2010, the earthquake 300,000 deaths 7.0 magnitude relatively lower than tohoku earthquake japan 2011 9.0 magnitude 28,000 deaths",
					"mount pinatubo, mount vesuvius, italy philippines\nmore commonly found on convergent plate boundary where magma is from melted subducted crust melted crust upper layer of crust\n\nconcave profile with steep sides, secondary vents are more commonly seen common\nhas high silica lava\nhigh silica lava flows slowly and solidifies after travelling a shorter distance, hence does not spread out quickly\nthe high silica lava also traps gas easily which results in high great explosive power upon release of gases.\nreleases lava, ash and rocks\nwith each successful eruption, it slowly creates a high volcano",
					"the higher the population density, the greater the extent of damage caused by earthquakes\nwhen an earthquake occurs in sparsely populated areas such as rural villages, people are less likely to be affected and lesser damage is done to buildings. as compared to densely populated areas such as izumit, turkey and haiti, there will be greater damage to infrastructure and higher cause of deaths\n\nfor example, the earthquake haiti 2010 magnitude 7.0 caused 300,000 deaths. earthquake in tohoku, japan in 2011 with magnitude of 9.0 caused 28,000 deaths. as haiti is much more densely populated than tohoku, japan, it suffered a higher death toll",
					"the epicentre is directly above the focus. the closer an area is to the epicentre, the greater the shaking experienced, hence more damage\nfor example, the earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand in 2011, with a magnitude of 6.9, the central business district was just 10km away from the epicentre. as compared to the earthquake in valdivia, chile in 1960 with a magnitude of 9.5 the distance from epicentre caused extensive damages to buildings in christchurch",
					"in loose and unconsolidated sediments, it can amplify the seismic waves, causing greater shaking and hence more damage. buildings built on these kind of soil can also face liquefaction (liquefaction is when the shaking of the ground causes the loose and saturated soil to flow like liquid, causing structures to sink)\n\nfor example, the earthquake in christchurch, new zealand in 2011 with a magnitude of 6.1, as the eastern sections of the city were built on a former swamp, the area faced liquefaction. properties and streets were covered in thick layers buried of silt and had to be abandoned.",
					"the time of occurrence determines where people are and what they are doing. if an earthquake occurs at midnight when people are sleeping, there would be a higher number of people trapped in their homes as they are less aware of their surroundings and hence are unable to evacuate\n\nfor example, an earthquake occurred a few hours past midnight in 1999 in the Sun Moon Lake region of Taiwan. although the magnitude was relatively high at 7.2, the high death toll of 1200 was attributed to the time of occurrence",
					"threaten the lives of people\ncauses destruction to property\ndisrupt daily activities",
					"during an earthquake, supply of electricity, gas and water can be disrupted, potentially affecting a lot of people. shaking of the ground can damage pipes and snap cables which causes a disruption of supply of electricity, gas and water. telecommunications can also be disrupted such as telephone communications and television broadcast.\n\nfor example, the earthquake in Kobe, Japan in 1995 with a magnitude of 6.9, damaged transmission lines and pipes, this disrupted the supply of water, electricity and gas to about a million of Kobe city's 1.4million residents",
					"shaking of the ground can weaken the slopes and hills of mountains. this can the slopes to be unstable which will result in landslides rapid downslope movement of vegetation debris, soil and rocks. they can range from several metres to a few kilometres in both length and width. mudflows can also occur as a result of heavy rainfall saturating the soil\n\nfor example, an earthquake off the coast of Peru in 1970 destablised the slopes of Mount Huascaran with resulted in landslides (160km/h) that flattened the town of Ranrahirca in seconds, killing more than 18,000 people with only 200 survivors",
					"homes may be destroyed during earthquakes and this results in the need for temporary shelters to be built while the homes are being rebuilt\n\nfor example, the earthquake in tohoku, japan in 2011 with a magnitude of 9.0 resulted in the tsunamis waves travelling up to 10km inland. this swept away houses out to sea and cause widespread destruction to properties. as a result, there was a severe housing shortage and a long term consequence on people's mental health",
					"cracks can be formed on infrastructure such as buildings, roads and bridges transportation may also be disrupted as the roads are unsafe to be used\n\nfor example, the earthquake in kobe, japan in 1995 resulted in damaged bridges and roads which made places hard to reach get to and made some places inaccessible",
					"earthquakes and its related hazards such as tsunamis and landslides threaten the lives of people living in earthquake zones\n\nfor example,\nearthquake in sichuan, china in 2008 resulted in 100,000 deaths (mag ? idk)\nearthquake in tohoku, japana in 2011 resulted in 28,000 deaths mag 9.0\nearthquake in haiti in 2010 resulted in 300,000 deaths mag 7.0\nearthquake off the coast of indian ocean in 2006 with mag 9.2",
					"land use regulations refer to the control of development in certain areas such as fault lines, areas prone to liquefaction and/or tsunamis\n\nfor example, in california, united states of america (usa), buildings are not allowed to be built on fault lines to limit damage caused by earthquakes\nor in japan, buildings are not allowed to be constructed on areas prone to tsunamis such as low lying lands until protective barriers such as sea walls are constructed\nor in memphis, usa, buildings are not allowed to be built on areas prone to liquefaction (vibrations in the ground causes loose and unconsolidated sediments to flow like liquid, causing structures to sink, and hence should not be built here)\n\nthis allows the government to carefully and safely plan out land use\n\nhowever this can be costly as some of the land might belong to private owners\nhence the government may have to acquire buy the land and compensate the land owners after that\nhowever some land owners might be reluctant to give up their land even though it is unsafe",
					"occurs when a dense, sinking oceanic plate gets forced beneath a less dense slower moving plate in a process subduction. the subducted plate pulls the rest of the plate along and drives the downward-moving portion of convection currents. the mantle material found away from where the plate subducts drives the rising portion of convection currents",
					"cyclones, tornadoes, heat waves (related to long-term weather patterns and climate of a place | related to atmosphere)",
					"due to the immense pressure exerted by surrounding layers, the inner core is a solid layer whereas the outer core is a liquid layer\nthe outer core is thicker at 2100km inner core 1400km",
					"occurs immediately and lasts for weeks or months",
					"denser than the continental crust\nbeneath deep oceans\n5 to 8km thick\nmade up of mainly granite a heavy and dense rock formed from the quick cooling of magma\nsmall range of rock ages from recent to less than 200million years ago"

					"the epicentre is directly above the earthquake's focus, hence the closer an area is to the epicentre, the greater the shaking experienced, hence greater extent of damage\n\nfor example, the earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand 2011, the magnitude was relatively low at 6.2, as compared to Valdivia, Chile, 1960, where the magnitude is at 9.5. as a result of the distance from the epicentre, there was more extensive damage to buildings in christchurch",
					"between the pacific and indian plate\noccurs when the plates slide past each other\n\nat the plate boundary, no landforms are created. the only landform created is a transform fault. such as the anatolian transform fault. at the fault, high amount of pressure gets built up and when the pressure is eventually released, violent earthquakes occur\n\nas a result of this tectonic activity, earthquakes are common at the plate boundaries. volcanic eruptions do not occur here as there is no subduction of plates",
					"a tsunami is an usually large wave (formed as a result of an offshore earthquake, or underwater volcanic eruption, or landslides above sea level, causing materials to plunge into the water\n\nseismic waves from an offshore earthquake forces out a mass of seawater\nat the start, the tsunami may reach to heights of less than 1m with wave lengths of between 100 to 150m\nupon reaching shallower waters, there is greater friction which slows the waves down, forcing it to increase in height\nat the point on impact at coast, the waves could be travelling at 30-50kmh at heights of 15m\nsometimes, sea may recede from the coast, usually seconds before the tsunami hits, this is due to water filling up the void created by the earthquake\n\nfor example, in 2004, an earthquake 9.2 occurred at the Indian Ocean which triggered large tsunamis. the tsunami affected coastal communities in 12 countries, including the coastal city of Banda Aceh, Indonesia\nthe tsunamis travelled up to 10km inland, sweeping houses away out to sea\nthe most affected was the low lying area of Sumatra, West Java in Indonesia",

					"earthquakes are formed during convergent and transform plate boundaries\nhuge amt of pressure gets built up on either side on the rocks on either side of the fault\nwhen the stress is eventually released, the plates can slip many metres, causing earthquakes",
					"segments of earth's crust",
					"shaking of the ground can weaken the slopes of hills and mountains, this can destabilise the slopes causing landslides\nlandslides are rapid downslope movement of soil vegetation, rocks and sand. they can range from several metres to a few kilometres in both length and height.\nmudflows can also occur as a result of heavy rainfall causing the soil to be saturated and it to flow like water\n\nfor example, the earthquake off the coast of Peru in 1970 with a magnitude of 7.9, destablised the slopes of Mount Huascaran which triggered landslides that moved as fast as 160kmh. the town of Ranrahirca was flattened in seconds, killing 18000 people and with only 200 survivors",
					"occurs when a dense, sinking plate gets forced beneath under a less dense plate in a process known as subduction. the subducted plate drives the downward-moving portion of convection currents. the subducted plate pulls the rest of the plate along. the mantle material found away from the subducted plate drives the rising portion of convection currents.",
					"refers to the movement of heat within the mantle material. earth's core heats up the mantle material, causing it to rise and expand, spreading out, dragging the rest of the plate along, causing divergent plate boundaries\nas the mantle material gets further away from the core, it cools slightly, sinking and pulling the rest of the plate along, causing convergent or transform plate boundaries",
					"combination of hot rocks and superheated gases that flow down the side of an erupting volcano",
					"a form of preparedness measure where people practise the steps to take during an earthquake. this aims to create awareness and reduce the irrational behavior during an earthquake.\n\nfor example, on every 1st september, since 1960, japan commemorates disaster prevention day where an earthquake of high magnitude is simulated. this helps to mentally or even physically prepare citizens for an earthquake.\n\nthis can reduce the loss of lives\n\nhowever emergency drills are often designed based on the most serious earthquake ever recorded in the area hence they may be inadequate to prevent the devastation by earthquakes of higher magnitude\nfor example, the tohoku earthquake in japan in 2011 occurred on a scale never experienced before\nthere is usually not enough time to escape as warnings are made seconds before the earthquake strikes",
					"air movement from an area of high pressure to low pressure\nmeasured using an anemometer or a wind vane\nwind vane points to where the wind is coming from\n",
					"volcanic stones and lava can break down to form volcanic soil\nthey are fertile, beneficial for farming (agriculture)\nthey support the cultivation of crops such as coffee, tea and rice\n\ne.g. in indonesia, the two islands of Java and Bali have plenty of volcanic soil\nthis is why these two islands are able to support large rural population for many years.\ncash crops - coffee and tea for source of income\nsource of food from food crops such as rice",
					"occurs immediately and can last for weeks",
					"summer in the southern hemisphere during october and february causes air over australia to be hot, causing a region of higher pressure\nwinter in the northern hemisphere during the same period causes air over central asia to be dense and cool, causing a region of lower pressure\nas a result of the pressure difference, a pressure gradient is formed and northeast wind moves from australia towards the southern hemisphere\nas the northeast winds cross the equator, it gets deflected towards the right, forming the northeast monsoon winds\nthe wind carries moisture from the Indian Ocean, bringing it towards the indian subcontinent",
					"in areas where the sediments is loose and unconsolidated, seismic waves can be amplified, causing greater shaking and hence damager. buildings built on saturated and unconsolidated soil can be affected by liquefaction. liquefaction is when the shaking of the ground, causing the loose and saturated soil to be unstable, hence it flows like liquid, causing sinking structures\n\nfor example, the earthquake in christchurch, new zealand in 2011, with a magnitude of 6.1, the eastern sections of the city were built on a former swamp, and hence the area faced liquefaction. causing the streets and properties to be buried by thick layers of silt and had to be abandoned",
					"the time that an earthquake occurs determines where people are and what they are doing. if an earthquake occurs at night when most people are sleeping, it can result in a higher death toll as people are trapped in their apartments as they are less aware of their surroundings\n\nfor example, the earthquake in 1999 at Sun Moon Lake region in Taiwan, although the magnitude was relatively high at 7.5, the death toll was 2,400. the high death toll is mainly attributed to the time of occurrence",
					"occurs within the upper 70km of earth's crust\nlarger impact to earth's surface as seismic waves takes a shorter time to reach the earth's surface",
					"magma fills up the magma chamber, pressure builds up\nwhen the pressure is great enough, it forces mamga out onto earth's surface through a vent\na vent is an opening in the earth's surface with a pipe leading to the magma chamber\nmagma that reaches the earth's surface is known as lava\nlava accumulates around the vent, building up the volcano\na crater is a bowl-shaped opening where lava, rock fragments and ashes are ejected\nwith each eruption, the lava builds on the previous layer\nduring eruption, if the primary vent is blocked, magma would find a secondary exit route usually through secondary vents",

A fault is a fracture in the rocks along which rocks are displaced, which is caused by tensional forces. This occurs in a process called faulting. As sections of the crust extend along fault lines, the central block between two parallel faults sinks due to tensional forces. Thus, a rift valley is formed. An example is the East African Rift Valley (or Great Rift Valley; African Rift Valley). A rift valley is a valley with steep sides. The sections which are left standing beside the rift valley are block mountains. At some areas, magma rises to the earth’s surface to form volcanoes.

											"‘Developed countries are better able to respond to the negative effects of an earthquake.’ To what extent do you agree with this statement? Explain your answer with examples": [
												"I agree with this answer to a large extent. There are many ways a country can respond to the negative effects of an earthquake. When a country responds to an earthquake, it also prepares for the next one by improving its current preparation methods. Less developed countries are much more limited in terms of what they can do to respond to the negative effects of an earthquake.\n\n\nOne way a country can respond to the negative effects of an earthquake is by rebuilding infrastructure. Less developed countries have limited resources such as funding to rebuild infrastructure that was damaged during the earthquake. Not only that, they may also lack the authority power to enforce stricter building codes, hence infrastructure may be rebuilt again without improvements made to the building code. Whereas developed countries have the resources and authority to rebuild infrastructure and enforce stricter building codes. Infrastructures are rebuilt and improved successfully after an earthquake. For example, after the earthquake in Kobe, Japan in 1995, the government spent billions in developing more earthquake resistant buildings. Hence, rebuilding infrastructure is one way a country can respond to the negative effects of an earthquake\n\n\nA country can also provision health care. To help injured victims or psychologically disturbed victims restore their livelihood, health options such as counselling is provided. This would allow them to cope with the loss of homes, jobs and loved ones better. But in a less developed country, such as Haiti for example, was unable to provide sufficient health workers for a large number of people after the earthquake in 2010. Providing sufficient medical care for the population was in itself a challenge due to the high death toll and number of casualties. In addition, it faced a lack of medical centres and medical staff to provide basic health care. Thus, more advanced medical aid such as counselling would be even more challenging.\n\n\nA country can also carry out search and rescue as a response to the negative effects of an earthquake. Search and rescue and save people who are still trapped in the buildings especially after earthquakes where buildings face a risk of collapsing, trapping the people inside it. But in a less developed country such as Haiti, lack of resources such as heat sensors and sniffer dogs hinder the effectiveness of this response and may be rendered ineffective. \n\n\nAlthough there are many ways a country can respond to the negative effects of an earthquake, less developed countries are heavily limited by their extent of funding, and availability of resources, as opposed to developed countries.",

					"the amount of preparation taken by authorities and citizens can make a significant impact\ngenerally, an earthquake is more manageable when people are well prepared for it\n\nfor example in japan, since 1960 on every september 1st it commemorates disaster prevention day where emergency drills are carried out. an earthquake of high magnitude is stimulated. this helps people to mentally and even physically prepared for an actual earthquake\n\nthis can reduce the loss of lives\n\nhowever in less developed countries, such as Haiti, emergency drills are not as frequently carried out. hence the earthquake in Haiti in 2010 even though it has a lower magnitude at 7.0, than the earthquake in Tohoku, Japan, 2011, with a magnitude of 9.0. it suffered 300,000 deaths and 28,000 deaths\nemergency drills are often only designed based on the most serious earthquake recorded in the area\nwhen an earthquake on a larger scale never experienced before, emergency drills may be inadequate to prevent the devastation by the earthquake.\nthere is often insufficient time for evacuation after a warning is made",
					"the higher the population density, the higher the extent of damage\nin sparsely populated areas, such as rural villages, when an earthquake occurs, less people are affected by it. lesser damages to buildings and properties as compared to densely populated areas such as izumit, turkey or haiti\n\nthe earthquake in 2010 in haiti, with a magnitude of 7.0, it suffered a higher death toll as compared to tohoku, japan 2011 earthquake with a higher magnitude of 9.0 at 300,000 deaths as compared to japan's 28,000 deaths",
					"the epicentre is just directly above the focus, hence the closer an area is to the epicentre, the greater the shaking experienced, greater extent of damage\n\nfor example, the earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand in 2011, the epicentre was just 10km away from the central business district. as compared to the earthquake in valdivia, chile with a magnitude of 9.5, christchurch suffered extensive damages to its buildings as a result of the distance from epicentre",
					"in areas with unconsolidated soil, seismic waves may be amplified, resulting in greater shaking. buildings built on loose and unconsolidated soil can also face liquefaction. liquefaction is when the loose and saturated soil becomes unstable, causing it to flow like liquid, causing buildings to sink\n\nfor example,&nbsp; christchurch, new zealand. the eastern sections of the city were built on a former swamp, hence as a result of the earthquake in 2011, properties and streets were buried by thick layers of silt and had to be abandoned",
					"the time of place determines where people are and what they are doing. if an earthquake occurs at night, when most people are sleeping, there would be more people trapped in their homes and apartments, resulting in higher death tolls as people are less aware of their surroundings\n\nfor example, in 1999, an earthquake struck in the Sun Moon Lake region of Taiwan a few hours past midnight. even though the magnitude was relatively high at 7.2, the high death toll of 24,000 was attributed to the time of occurrence"

											"‘Developed countries are better able to respond to the negative effects of an earthquake.’ To what extent do you agree with this statement? Explain your answer with examples": [
												"I agree with this answer to a large extent. There are many ways a country can respond to the negative effects of an earthquake. When a country responds to an earthquake, it also prepares for the next one by improving its current preparation methods. Less developed countries are much more limited in terms of what they can do to respond to the negative effects of an earthquake.\n\n\nOne way a country can respond to the negative effects of an earthquake is by rebuilding infrastructure. Less developed countries have limited resources such as funding to rebuild infrastructure that was damaged during the earthquake. Not only that, they may also lack the authority power to enforce stricter building codes, hence infrastructure may be rebuilt again without improvements made to the building code. Whereas developed countries have the resources and authority to rebuild infrastructure and enforce stricter building codes. Infrastructures are rebuilt and improved successfully after an earthquake. For example, after the earthquake in Kobe, Japan in 1995, the government spent billions in developing more earthquake resistant buildings. Hence, rebuilding infrastructure is one way a country can respond to the negative effects of an earthquake\n\n\nA country can also provision health care. To help injured victims or psychologically disturbed victims restore their livelihood, health options such as counselling is provided. This would allow them to cope with the loss of homes, jobs and loved ones better. But in a less developed country, such as Haiti for example, was unable to provide sufficient health workers for a large number of people after the earthquake in 2010. Providing sufficient medical care for the population was in itself a challenge due to the high death toll and number of casualties. In addition, it faced a lack of medical centres and medical staff to provide basic health care. Thus, more advanced medical aid such as counselling would be even more challenging.\n\n\nA country can also carry out search and rescue as a response to the negative effects of an earthquake. Search and rescue and save people who are still trapped in the buildings especially after earthquakes where buildings face a risk of collapsing, trapping the people inside it. But in a less developed country such as Haiti, lack of resources such as heat sensors and sniffer dogs hinder the effectiveness of this response and may be rendered ineffective.\n\n\nAlthough there are many ways a country can respond to the negative effects of an earthquake, less developed countries are heavily limited by their extent of funding, and availability of resources, as opposed to developed countries.",
